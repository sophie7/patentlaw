<p>WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:</p>
<ol>
<li>A method of preventing information exposure to an image capturing device associated with a laboratory device;</li>
</ol>
<p>the image capturing device capturing at least one still image or video during operation of the laboratory device; and</p>
<p>preventing exposure of external information proximate to the laboratory device by obstructing a field of view of the image capturing device beyond a transparent member;</p>
<p>wherein the transparent member enables an internal view of the laboratory device from outside of the laboratory device.</p>
<ol>
<li>The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the field of view of the image</li>
</ol>
<p>capturing device beyond the transparent member is obstructed in real time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-2, wherein a user defines the filed of view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-3, wherein the field of view of the image capturing device is obstructed by one or more optical resources comprising a one-way mirror coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-3, wherein the field of view of the image capturing device is obstructed by one or more optical resources comprising a polarizing material coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the image capturing device is</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>coupled with a polarizing surface.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-6, wherein the image capturing device comprises a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-7, wherein the external information comprises any object beyond the transparent member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A laboratory device comprising:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>at least one image capturing device associated with the laboratory device, to capture at least one still image or video during operation of the laboratory device;</p>
<p>a transparent member coupled to the laboratory device, enabling an internal view into the laboratory device from outside the laboratory device; and</p>
<p>one or more optical resources coupled to the transparent member for obstructing a Field of View (FOV) of the at least one image capturing device beyond the transparent member preventing exposure of any external information proximate to the laboratory device.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The laboratory device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the one or more optical resources comprises a one-way mirror coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-10, wherein the one or more optical resources comprises a polarizing material coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The laboratory device as claimed in claim 11, wherein at least one image capturing device is coupled with a polarizing surface.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-12, wherein the image capturing device comprises a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-13, wherein the external information comprises any object beyond the transparent member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system comprising a laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-14 coupled to a computing device configured to store and display images captured by the image capturing device.</p>
</li>
</ol>
