WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:

1. A method of preventing information exposure to an image capturing device associated with a laboratory device;

the image capturing device capturing at least one still image or video during operation of the laboratory device; and

preventing exposure of external information proximate to the laboratory device by obstructing a field of view of the image capturing device beyond a transparent member;

wherein the transparent member enables an internal view of the laboratory device from outside of the laboratory device.

2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the field of view of the image

capturing device beyond the transparent member is obstructed in real time.

3. The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-2, wherein a user defines the filed of view.

4. The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-3, wherein the field of view of the image capturing device is obstructed by one or more optical resources comprising a one-way mirror coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.

5. The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-3, wherein the field of view of the image capturing device is obstructed by one or more optical resources comprising a polarizing material coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.

6. The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the image capturing device is

coupled with a polarizing surface.

7. The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-6, wherein the image capturing device comprises a camera.

8. The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-7, wherein the external information comprises any object beyond the transparent member.

9. A laboratory device comprising:

at least one image capturing device associated with the laboratory device, to capture at least one still image or video during operation of the laboratory device;

a transparent member coupled to the laboratory device, enabling an internal view into the laboratory device from outside the laboratory device; and

one or more optical resources coupled to the transparent member for obstructing a Field of View (FOV) of the at least one image capturing device beyond the transparent member preventing exposure of any external information proximate to the laboratory device.

10. The laboratory device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the one or more optical resources comprises a one-way mirror coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.

11. The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-10, wherein the one or more optical resources comprises a polarizing material coupled to an inner wall of the transparent member.

The laboratory device as claimed in claim 11, wherein at least one image capturing device is coupled with a polarizing surface.

12. The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-12, wherein the image capturing device comprises a camera.

13. The laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-13, wherein the external information comprises any object beyond the transparent member.

14. A system comprising a laboratory device as claimed in any of the preceding claims 9-14 coupled to a computing device configured to store and display images captured by the image capturing device.
