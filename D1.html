<h1>WHAT IS CLAIMED IS</h1>

<p>1 . A system for controlling visibility of information in a work environment, the system comprising:</p>
<p>a robotic device connected to a network and configured to operate and interact in the work environment, the robotic device including a camera;</p>
<p>a pilot at a workspace remote from the work environment, wherein the interaction of the pilot in the work environment is through the robotic device, and wherein the pilot and the robotic device share privileges and permissions for interactions in the work environment;</p>
<p>a user interface presented to the pilot through a station configured to allow the pilot at the remote workspace to operate the robotic device;</p>
<p>a primary polarizing filter adjustably attached to the camera;</p>
<p>at least one light source remote from the robotic device; and</p>
<p>at least one secondary polarizing filter positioned between the at least one light source and the camera;</p>
<p>wherein the primary polarizing filter can be adjusted to selectively prevent transmission of images in the work environment to the pilot.</p>
<p>2 . The system of claim 1 further comprising a database connected to the network where privileges and permissions of the pilot are stored and can be accessed for the robotic device.
claim 1</p>
<p>3 . The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source comprises an electrically-generated light.
claim 1</p>
<p>4 . The system of claim 3, wherein the electrically-generated light comprises a display screen.
claim 3</p>
<p>5 . The system of claim 4, wherein the display screen comprises an LCD or LED display.
claim 4</p>
<p>6 . The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source comprises an infrared radiation source.
claim 1</p>
<p>7 . A system for selectively preventing visibility of information in a work environment, the system comprising:</p>
<p>a robotic device connected to a network and configured to operate and interact in the work environment, the robotic device including a camera;</p>
<p>a pilot at a workspace remote from the work environment, wherein the interaction of the pilot in the work environment is through the robotic device, and wherein the pilot and the robotic device share privileges and permissions for interactions in the work environment;</p>
<p>a station providing a user interface configured to allow the pilot to operate the robotic device from the remote workspace;</p>
<p>a primary polarizing filter adjustably attached to the camera;</p>
<p>at least one light source remote from the robotic device; and</p>
<p>at least one secondary polarizing filter positioned between the at least one light source and the camera;</p>
<p>wherein information in the work environment is proximate the at least one light source and at least one secondary polarizing filter;</p>
<p>wherein the network is configured to store the physical location of information in the work environment;</p>
<p>wherein the primary polarizing filter can be adjusted to selectively prevent transmission of information in the work environment to the pilot.</p>
<p>8 . The system of claim 7 further comprising a database connected to the network where privileges and permissions of the pilot are stored and can be accessed for the robotic device.
claim 7</p>
<p>9 . The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one light source comprises an electrically-generated light.
claim 8</p>
<p>10 . The system of claim 9, wherein the electrically-generated light comprises a display screen.
claim 9</p>
<p>11 . The system of claim 10, wherein the display screen comprises an LCD or LED display.
claim 10</p>
<p>12 . The system of claim 10, wherein the physical location of the display screen is identified by barcode or RFID.
claim 10</p>
<p>13 . The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one light source comprises reflected light off a vertical surface.
claim 8</p>
<p>14 . The system of claim 13, wherein the vertical surface comprises a whiteboard.
claim 13</p>
<p>15 . The system of claim 14, wherein the physical location of the whiteboard is identified by barcode or RFID.
claim 14</p>
<p>16 . A system for controlling visibility of information in a work environment, the system comprising:</p>
<p>a robotic device connected to a network and configured to operate and interact in the work environment, the robotic device including a camera;</p>
<p>a pilot at a workspace remote from the work environment, wherein the interaction of the pilot in the work environment is through the robotic device, and wherein the pilot and the robotic device share privileges and permissions for interactions in the work environment;</p>
<p>a user interface presented to the pilot through a station configured to allow the pilot at the remote workspace to operate the robotic device;</p>
<p>a primary polarizing filter adjustably attached to the camera;</p>
