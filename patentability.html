	Article 52 EPC: Patentable inventions 
	(1) European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, 
	involve an inventive step and are susceptible of industrial application. 
	(2) The following in particular shall not be regarded as inventions within the meaning of paragraph 1:	
	(a) discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods; 
	(b) aesthetic creations; 
	(c) schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, 
	and programs for computers; 
	(d) presentations of information. 
	(3) The provisions of paragraph 2 shall exclude patentability of the subject-matter or activities referred to therein only to the extent
	to which a European patent application or European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as such. 
	
	Article 53 EPC: exceptions to patentability 
	European patents shall not be granted in respect of: 
	(a) inventions the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to "ordre public" or morality; such exploitation shall not be deemed
	to be so contrary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation in some or all of the Contracting States;

	Part G: Patentability 

	Chapter VI - Novelty 
	6. Implicit disclosure and parameters 
	In the case of a prior-art document, the lack of novelty may be apparent from what is explicitly stated in the document itself. 
	Alternatively, it may be implicit in the sense that, in carrying out the teaching of the prior-art document, the skilled person would inevitably
	arrive at a result falling within the terms of the claim.   


	Chapter VII - Inventive step 
	5. Problem-and-solution approach 
	In order to assess inventive step in an objective and predictable manner, the so-called "problem-solution approach" is applied. 
	In the problem-solution approach, there are three main stages: 
	(a) determining the "closest prior art", 
	(b) establishing the "objective technical problem" to be solved, and 
	(c) considering whether or not the claimed invention, starting from the closest prior art and the objective technical problem, 
	would have been obvious to the skilled person. 
	5.1 Determining the closest prior art 
	The closest prior art is that which in one single reference discloses the combination of features which constitutes the most promising
	starting point for a development leading to the invention. In selecting the closest prior art, the first consideration is that it must
	be directed to a similar purpose or effect as the invention or at least belong to the same or a closely related technical field as the 
	claimed invention. In practice, the closest prior art is generally that which corresponds to a similar use and requires the minimum of
	structural and functional modifications to arrive at the claimed invention. 
	... 

	5.2 Formulation of the objective technical problem 
	In the second stage, one establishes in an objective way the technical problem to be solved. To do this one studies the application (or the patent),
	the closest prior art and the difference (also called the "distinguishing feature(s)" of the claimed invention) in terms of features (either structural or functional) 
	between the claimed invention and the closest prior art, identifies the technical effect resulting from the distinguishing features, and then formulates the technical problem. 
	... 

	5.3 Could-would approach 
	In the third stage the question to be answered is whether there is any teaching in the prior art as a whole that <strong>would</strong> (not simply could, but would) have prompted the skilled person,
	faced with the objective technical problem, to modify or adapt the closest prior art while taking account of that teaching, thereby arriving at something falling within the terms of the claims,
	and thus achieving what the invention achieves. 
	...
